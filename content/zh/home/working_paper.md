  - title: Canada’s Innovation Strategy Development
    desc: |
      Conducted a machine learning analysis on the Global Innovation Index, translating insights from top-performing countries into strategic recommendations aimed at elevating Canada’s innovation rank. By training regression models and evaluating critical feature coefficients, I provided data-backed guidance to support policy-makers and business leaders in fostering economic growth and innovation competitiveness.

  - title: "Discrete Mathematics in Sudoku: Combinatorics and Graph Theory"
    desc: |
      Performed a mathematical analysis of Sudoku puzzles using discrete mathematics, focusing on combinatorics and graph theory to quantify possible grid arrangements and solve puzzles with unique solutions. By leveraging permutation, combination, and graph coloring techniques, developed an efficient method to address puzzles with extreme clue scenarios. Demonstrated the applicability of mathematical modeling to real-world problem-solving, providing insights into the logical structure and constraints of Sudoku puzzles.
